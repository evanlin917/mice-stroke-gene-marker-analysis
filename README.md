# Temporal Gene Ontology Analysis of Genetic Expression Markers in Murine Ischemic Stroke

## Project Overview
This repository contains a gene ontology analysis of genetic expression markers in micec following ischemic stroke, examining changes at 2, 4, and 6 months post-stroke. The analysis focuses specifically on organelle genetic markers to understand organelle-specific responses to stroke pathology over time.

## Implementation
Analysis is implemented in R using Jupyter notebooks. The code examines temporal changes in genetic markers and performs gene ontology enrichment analysis to identify affected biological pathways.

## Project Status
:warning: This project is currently under active development. Methods and analyses may change as the project evolves.

## Dataset Description
The data set consists of gene expression measurements from mouse brain tissue following induced ischemic stroke, with samples collected at three time points:
* 2 months post-stroke
* 4 months post-stroke
* 6 months post-stroke

Each time point includes both stroke-affected and control mice. Expression data focuses on genes associated with organelle function. 

> **Data Availability**: The original dataset comes from Weill Cornell's Feil Family Brain and Mind Institute. If you would like access to the raw data for replication purposes, please contact the repository owner.

## Dependencies
* R 4.x
